Sometimes I get a little paranoid, but they can use software like Net nanny and employee monitoring software. I don&#039;t. I just stay in an inPrivate browser. I live downtown so I can tell. I&#039;m looking for a volunteer accountant because all the others in the area what about $200 an hour. And I need to become established the software valuation would be kinda high but those are fixed assets. Now I&#039;m just hoping to look at time and salary for liquidity.

I hate that too.  Michael is doing well, he lives in Jonesborough (he&#039;s on my friends list actually) he&#039;s married w/5 kids and is a preacher.  My mom is well, she and my dad are living in Seymour and she teaches Pre-K for Knox County schools.  I can&#039;t say that I know much about Rebekah other than that she lives in CA now.  She had a falling out w/me and my Mom and sister several years ago when she still lived here in TN.  The 3 of us haven&#039;t talked to her since.  Our cousin Danielle unfortunately got the shaft on that deal too which I feel bad about b/c she did nothing.  Grandma Vaughn is in Johnson City too.  They would all be glad to talk to you, I know.

I just graduated this past Friday w/a degree in medical transcription and am going back in the fall to finish up general courses so I can start nursing school in fall 2011.  It sounds like you have done well for yourself.. I&#039;m happy for you.  My mom will be happy to know that I found you.  She and I were talking about your mom and we started talking about how we wondered where you were.  I said I would try to find you on here and when I spoke to her earlier, I told her that I found someone I hoped was you, so I will let her know it is!

Charlene was my aunt, sister to my mom, Debbie Bright.  If any of this is sounding familiar to you, maybe you are him.  Please write me back and let me know.  If it is you, I&#039;d love to talk to you.. we&#039;ve all wondered about how he has been doing.

I have XP and Vista discs. If its Vista all you would have to do is insert the Vista disc, reboot. You might have to change your BIOS settings to make your computer start from the DVD. You might not.

I haven&#039;t heard from anyone about the business end. About the user group, I first need to see if there would be enough students to join the group. Is there a min. requirement? I can look online to see how to start one for the school. I&#039;ll let you know more when I do. Also would you be willing to look at my resume? I understand if you don&#039;t have the time. Have a great night! :)</p><div class="message"><div class="message_header"><span class="user">Lauren Cooney</span><span class="meta">Monday, January 18, 2010 at 2:34pm EST</span></div></div><p>Thanks Jonathan!

Have they gotten back to you? This would be great!

How can I help?/LC</p><div class="message"><div class="message_header"><span class="user">Jonathan Moore</span><span class="meta">Thursday, January 14, 2010 at 11:03pm EST</span></div></div><p>Hi Lauren,

A lot has happened since our last email. My business will be joining the empower for ISV program hopefully by mid-summer. I have learned a lot about the Bizspark program as well. Timing could not be better. The Bizspark program gives me the tools needed to develop a marketable solution until my business is able to join the ISV program. It also has a lot of the benefits as well which I&#039;m sure you are aware of. One is being visibility. I wish my business nothing but success. That being said, I am still a Computer Science student with nine courses&#039; left to graduate. And time is valuable. I talked to the head of IT here and he thought it would be nice to have a user group here on campus. That is something I have experience in since I operated one for Macromedia for many years. What do you think? Then there would be a reason for an event. We just installed Windows 7 in the new CS lab. Maybe seven is something that could be presented. As I am getting ready to graduate I am putting together my resume. It reflects my proficiencies but I am really focusing on a certain concentration. That being WPF, Silverlight and WCF RIA Services. I emailed a copy to Daniela Luzi Tudor who works or worked for Microsoft. I would like you to look at it if you want to. Because no matter if it’s my business as a partner or as an employee. I want Microsoft always to be a part of my life. I hope this message finds you well and I hope you had a happy birthday.</p><div class="message"><div class="message_header"><span class="user">Jonathan Moore</span><span class="meta">Tuesday, December 1, 2009 at 12:18am EST</span></div></div><p>Just sent it to you&#039;re MSFT address Thanks Lauren!</p><div class="message"><div class="message_header"><span class="user">Lauren Cooney</span><span class="meta">Monday, November 30, 2009 at 11:54pm EST</span></div></div><p>Hi Jonathan,

Thanks for emailing me! Can you email this to me at my MSFT address lcooney&#064;microsoft.com and I&#039;ll get some folks on this thread to see what we can do.

What more do you want from the BizSpark program? have you looked at WebsiteSpark? 

We will do our best to make an event happen as well. Is it a user group or larger event? 

Look forward to hearing from you!

My company is in the Bizspark program. It is also a Microsoft Partner. I&#039;ve personally been developing for Windows since around 2000. I have decided to use Silverlight and WCF RIA Services for the comapny website. I&#039;ve taken my blog down simply because I don&#039;t have time to devote to the company and to it both. The product that the company is working on has to do with Social Networking software. Both for the web/desktop and hopefully surface. Which means there is a lot of C# and XAML. My question is, What advice whould you give for a startup? I&#039;m also a Computer Science Major at UVA and would love to have a Microsoft event sometime next year. Any help/advice you can give would be greatly appreciated. Thank You and have a great day.</p><div class="message"><div class="message_header"><span class="user">Jonathan Moore</span><span class="meta">Monday, November 9, 2009 at 1:19am EST</span></div></div><p>Just wanted to say Hi!

Just wanted you to hear from me first, that I am switching salons starting this coming week! I will be working at the new Kloud 9 Salon and Spa in Norton. This is a full service salon offering all hair services, pedicures, manicures, waxing, facials, massage etc. Ashley Fryatt from Geneses and myself, will be the stylists so you can expect the same service as before and a whole lot more. I&#039;ve really enjoyed doing your hair and would love to continue to do so! Feel free to msg me on here or call at 276-644-2081 (once I start next week).

One other quick request. Can you please remove my and Cassandra&#039;s names from the &quot;Connect&quot; page on the magazine website? Here&#039;s the link for the page:

Thanks!

It&#039;s a shame the mag sucks, though. So much for us building it up, huh?

How&#039;s school and work going? I miss chatting with you and our YouTube breaks. There&#039;s a ton of chattering media relations ladies all around me all day, lol.

If you&#039;re ever in Knoxville, send me a message or give me a call and we can have lunch or grab a beer.

Take care,
Rog

P.S. Send me a pdf of the mag, wink-wink. You&#039;ve got me curious about how it looks now, lol.

I used to have bad friends and low self-esteem, and before I became an author I didn&#039;t have many friends on Facebook, and the friends I did have didn&#039;t interact with me much. I am extremely introverted. The job I had for 4 years as a research assistent demanded that I project a positive, pleasant public profile. I noticed that people responded well to that. Meh.

Wanted to let you know that we have our presentation done for GIS.  It isn&#039;t really much.  Only like 15-20 slides.  Our little presentation is going to be next Wednesday.  I&#039;m pretty sure this is the final thing for the class and we won&#039;t have to meet again for the semester.  But I suppose we&#039;ll be more fully informed next class.  

Anyway, we&#039;ll be meeting up before the class next week.  Around 5pm in the Science computer lab.  It&#039;ll just to be assigning who explains what slide and all. :)</p></div><div class="thread">Eleanor Anne Lafoon, Jonathan Moore<div class="message"><div class="message_header"><span class="user">Eleanor Anne Lafoon</span><span class="meta">Monday, November 14, 2011 at 5:46pm EST</span></div></div><p>bye!</p><div class="message"><div class="message_header"><span class="user">Jonathan Moore</span><span class="meta">Monday, November 14, 2011 at 5:46pm EST</span></div></div><p>ttyl</p><div class="message"><div class="message_header"><span class="user">Jonathan Moore</span><span class="meta">Monday, November 14, 2011 at 5:44pm EST</span></div></div><p>before I delete my facebook i&#039;ll make sure we are still connected</p><div class="message"><div class="message_header"><span class="user">Eleanor Anne Lafoon</span><span class="meta">Monday, November 14, 2011 at 5:43pm EST</span></div></div><p>I will thanks!</p><div class="message"><div class="message_header"><span class="user">Jonathan Moore</span><span class="meta">Monday, November 14, 2011 at 5:43pm EST</span></div></div><p>so check out linkedin it&#039;s more professional and if you want to join, join </p><div class="message"><div class="message_header"><span class="user">Eleanor Anne Lafoon</span><span class="meta">Monday, November 14, 2011 at 5:41pm EST</span></div></div><p>okay</p><div class="message"><div class="message_header"><span class="user">Eleanor Anne Lafoon</span><span class="meta">Monday, November 14, 2011 at 5:41pm EST</span></div></div><p>yes</p><div class="message"><div class="message_header"><span class="user">Jonathan Moore</span><span class="meta">Monday, November 14, 2011 at 5:41pm EST</span></div></div><p>college uvawise</p><div class="message"><div class="message_header"><span class="user">Eleanor Anne Lafoon</span><span class="meta">Monday, November 14, 2011 at 5:41pm EST</span></div></div><p>you know who I am?</p><div class="message"><div class="message_header"><span class="user">Jonathan Moore</span><span class="meta">Monday, November 14, 2011 at 5:41pm EST</span></div></div><p>helps you make connections and build your resume</p><div class="message"><div class="message_header"><span class="user">Eleanor Anne Lafoon</span><span class="meta">Monday, November 14, 2011 at 5:41pm EST</span></div></div><p>elementary, High school, College?</p><div class="message"><div class="message_header"><span class="user">Eleanor Anne Lafoon</span><span class="meta">Monday, November 14, 2011 at 5:41pm EST</span></div></div><p>so, which school exactly?</p><div class="message"><div class="message_header"><span class="user">Eleanor Anne Lafoon</span><span class="meta">Monday, November 14, 2011 at 5:40pm EST</span></div></div><p>oh nice</p><div class="message"><div class="message_header"><span class="user">Jonathan Moore</span><span class="meta">Monday, November 14, 2011 at 5:39pm EST</span></div></div><p>social networking for jobs</p><div class="message"><div class="message_header"><span class="user">Jonathan Moore</span><span class="meta">Monday, November 14, 2011 at 5:39pm EST</span></div></div><p>I have Microsoft people on my Linked In</p><div class="message"><div class="message_header"><span class="user">Eleanor Anne Lafoon</span><span class="meta">Monday, November 14, 2011 at 5:39pm EST</span></div></div><p>what&#039;s Linkedin?

I&#039;m thinking a TextBox for the messages, A TextBox to write your messeage and a send button. also we need some place for the user to enter a screen name and a button to join. A contact list would be great but I would save that for the end. Hope this helps :)</p><div class="message"><div class="message_header"><span class="user">Zack Sarver</span><span class="meta">Wednesday, November 4, 2009 at 3:07pm EST</span></div></div><p>Hey...

Are we doing any special features? I know we need a textblock and a textbox and a send button. I saw your prototype sketches... are we going to have a contact list? 

For my initial prototype so Ed can start linking everything together, what components do i need to add so he can get started?</p></div><div class="thread">Matt Beach, Jonathan Moore<div class="message"><div class="message_header"><span class="user">Matt Beach</span><span class="meta">Wednesday, June 13, 2012 at 12:00pm EDT</span></div></div><p>no problem</p><div class="message"><div class="message_header"><span class="user">Jonathan Moore</span><span class="meta">Wednesday, June 13, 2012 at 12:00pm EDT</span></div></div><p>ok thanks</p><div class="message"><div class="message_header"><span class="user">Matt Beach</span><span class="meta">Wednesday, June 13, 2012 at 12:00pm EDT</span></div></div><p>I&#039;ve not even seriously looked into upgrading my linux partitions yet</p><div class="message"><div class="message_header"><span class="user">Matt Beach</span><span class="meta">Wednesday, June 13, 2012 at 12:00pm EDT</span></div></div><p>not a clue</p><div class="message"><div class="message_header"><span class="user">Jonathan Moore</span><span class="meta">Wednesday, June 13, 2012 at 11:59am EDT</span></div></div><p>beach do you know how to use the kickstart configuation editor to create a gnome spin of fedora?</p><div class="message"><div class="message_header"><span class="user">Jonathan Moore</span><span class="meta">Wednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:43am EDT</span></div></div><p>probably</p><div class="message"><div class="message_header"><span class="user">Matt Beach</span><span class="meta">Wednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:42am EDT</span></div></div><p>So, maybe it&#039;s going to have more boring stuff in it than the paper does</p><div class="message"><div class="message_header"><span class="user">Jonathan Moore</span><span class="meta">Wednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:40am EDT</span></div></div><p>here is what the post said: &quot;UVa-Wise Weekly is a joint effort of News and Media Relations and Strategic Communications created to inform readers of happenings related to the college. &quot;</p><div class="message"><div class="message_header"><span class="user">Jonathan Moore</span><span class="meta">Wednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:39am EDT</span></div></div><p>i don&#039;t know</p><div class="message"><div class="message_header"><span class="user">Matt Beach</span><span class="meta">Wednesday, September 7, 2011 at 10:39am EDT</span></div></div><p>That&#039;s cool.

I&#039;m usually on AIM and I tend to get to emails to my gmail account pretty quick.  I&#039;m gonna try to be on msn now too, but that&#039;s if I can get it to work for me :-P.

We&#039;re working on queries for standardizing the party values, and the 4 digit years at the moment.

Anyway, I&#039;ll send you what we have later on tonight, or I could set up a dropbox folder if you use that.  

Feel better, and be in touch!

How have you been? I&#039;m just getting back into the swing of things with Silverlght/WCF RIA. I&#039;ve been working on the new website for the college. My question is and I think I asked you this before, but I &#039;m still a little bit confused. How do you create themes for Business apps in Sivlerlight 4/RIA. I know you use Blend, but can you open the Styles.xaml file directly and start designing? Thanks for any help you provide and have a great day! :)

How is Prism going to fit in. I know there are features in Silverlight 4 that were in Prism.

If you have your own scheme, you can inherit from AuthenticationBase and do what you need in those classes.

ASPNET authentication isn&#039;t just for SQLExpress though -- you can use it on full SQL server or write your own custom database provider that maps to the API for authentication and membership within ASPNET.</p><div class="message"><div class="message_header"><span class="user">Jonathan Moore</span><span class="meta">Saturday, November 14, 2009 at 5:53pm EST</span></div></div><p>Hi Tim, 

Great video on RIA Services! One question. About autenication how would you setup the database? I&#039;ve been using aspnet_regsql.exe to either setup the ASPNET DB or merge into an existing one. And what about the web.config file? Is this only good for SQL Server Express?

I&#039;m going to be designing a Silverlight Style for a RIA Business App. How and where would you start to design a style. Blend? or just code the XAML. I&#039;m starting to look at the themes that you have designed and they look very good. Thanks

Can you come by next Thursday, and we will reopen the case with Microsoft. The USB issue will more than likely have to be escalated since it is a complex problem, my guess is we might have to add some upperfilters in the registry. The other things should be a no brainer. I would do it this weekend but I have Algorithms and Simualtion HW.

Basically, the premise of people coming over tonight would be to discuss rescheduling the Nerd Night. (if you don&#039;t/can&#039;t come, don&#039;t worry.  There wasn&#039;t any forewarning, and I didn&#039;t confirm anything.  Really, it&#039;s my fault)

The original idea was to just reschedule it to the 5th of February, which is fine.  We can also do it the 12th of February, which has the benefit of being a week before the networking lecture, as well as giving us more advertising time.

Also, we have a need to run out and get all the stuff we need to raffle off.  Could we do this tomorrow?  If not tomorrow, Thursday at the latest.  Also, I was thinking we could either do a video game (Fallout 3 GotY edition or L4D2 are both $50)  Or we could see if Bob does gift certificates.

Halcyon&#039;s Dr. Andrew Bleloch

&quot;Elucidating BioNanoMachines: 
Microscopies at the Atomic Scale&quot;

Sakoon - 357 Castro St, Mtn View CA

Have you seen those beautiful animations illustrating how the complex molecular machinery in a cell works? 
(Ex. http://youtu.be/sa563MdIiXE ) Just how much of that is &#039;made up&#039;? How much is real? How is the information gathered, and what potentials can we unlock with it?

Foresight is proud to announce a dinner talk by Dr. Andrew Bleloch, Halcyon Molecular&#039;s Head of Microscopy. At Halcyon, Andrew applies the latest techniques in electron microscopy to the most important problem he&#039;s ever had the privilege of tackling — cheap, fast, ubiquitous genome sequencing. Andrew will speak not just about microscopy as applied to DNA, but other cutting-edge applications on the horizon.

Before coming to Halcyon, Andrew spent 17 years at Cambridge&#039;s Cavendish Laboratory, and 8 years running the UK&#039;s SuperSTEM Laboratory at Daresbury in conjunction with a professorship at the University of Liverpool. His interdisciplinary work in electron microscopy has allowed him to publish professionally in a wide range of fields, including biology, chemistry, materials science and physics.

This intimate dinner talk is located at Sakoon, a modern fine dining establishment specializing in indian cuisine. It begins at 7pm, reception for cash bar drinks/mingling at 6:30.

Two times a year Barter will feature one of its resident actors and take you down their career path. Many of the Barter Actor’s have been on tv, have done movies, have acted in countless theatres across the nation – this is your chance to see the story behind the actor.

We have an important goal to let people know: THE AIDS FREE GENERATION IS DUE IN 2015. Last year, nearly half a million babies were born with HIV. By 2015, that number could be zero.

Please let people know by changing your profile picture to a (2015) RED image.

THE LAZARUS EFFECT follows the story of people in Africa with HIV/AIDS who go from near death to health in as few as 40 days if they gain access to the 2 lifesaving pills that cost around 40 cents a day. Watch the trailer: http://f.joinred.com/kKD

Tune-in tonight on HBO at 9pm ET, Ch4 (UK) at 11pm GMT and online at YouTube starting from 9.30pm ET.

To help spread the word about the film, we’ve created a campaign with Bono, Hugh Jackman, Gwen Stefani, Don Cheadle &amp; many more to show the power of what 40 cents can buy. Have a look:

Today’s World AIDS Day – a time to honor all who are affected by AIDS. Cities, brands, organizations and people are coming together from all over the world to make one statement. That today ONE COLOR UNITES US. And that color is (RED).

Here’s how you can get involved. Help us turn Facebook &amp; Twitter (RED) today: 

Facebook: Share our video &amp; make your profile picture (RED). Get everything you need at: http://budurl.com/fbupd

Twitter: Use #red to turn the color of your tweets red. Go to http://budurl.com/twupd for more

Because of you, to date (RED) partners and events have sent $140 million to Africa which has supported programs that have helped reach 4 million people. 

To increase that number here’s what you can do today: 

Lace Up Save Lives: our new partner Nike contributes 100% of the profits from the sale of (NIKE) RED laces to fighting AIDS in Africa.

(NIKE)
http://budurl.com/nikefbu

Starbucks, Gap, Dell &amp; Bugaboo: see what extra contributions they are making today - http://budurl.com/moreupd

33 million people in the world have HIV. 22 million live in Africa. It costs around 40cents a day for the 2 pills that are needed to help keep someone living with HIV alive. Yet, more than 70% of the people in sub-Saharan Africa live on less than $2 a day.

Thank you for fighting AIDS in Africa. Thank you for being (RED).  

Chrysi &#064; (RED)</p><div class="message"><div class="message_header"><span class="user">(RED)</span><span class="meta">Monday, November 30, 2009 at 7:09pm EST</span></div></div><p>Today is a very exciting day. It’s the launch of (NIKE) RED in 13 countries around the world. Nike has created Nike (PRODUCT) RED laces – designed to fight AIDS in Africa. 100% of the profits go to the Global Fund and to Nike football-based programs (ie: soccer!).

(NIKE) RED launched today at NIKETOWN in London with Bono and some of the world’s best footballers - Didier Drogba (Chelsea), Joe Cole (Chelsea), Andrei Arshavin (Arsenal), Marco Materazzi (Inter Milan), Denilson (Arsenal), Lucas Neill (Everton), Clint Dempsey (Fulham) and Seol Ki-Hyeon (Fulham). It was incredible. The world press turned out to see this partnership come together.

We’re working with Nike to leverage the power of sport to fight HIV and AIDS in Africa. Together we’re focusing on two initiatives: Educate and Medicate. Our aim is to ensure that HIV positive people in Africa have access to the medicine they need to stay alive and to continue to build education programs through the power of sport.

The first product to be introduced are (NIKE) RED laces. The laces are specifically designed for football boots. But anyone can wear them. You, me, Drogba, Bono….and wear them in many ways. Bono’s been wearing them on the U2 360 tour and ‘Man of the Match’ Drogba actually wore them during yesterday’s Chelsea v. Arsenal match. Have a look: http://budurl.com/nikeupdate

So simple, yet so powerful! Lace Up Save Lives.

Jen &#064; (RED)</p><div class="message"><div class="message_header"><span class="user">(RED)</span><span class="meta">Wednesday, November 25, 2009 at 8:09pm EST</span></div></div><p>Hi.

Dec 1 is World AIDS Day. And we’re making a stand! We want ONE COLOR TO UNITE US – (RED). 

Starting now, help us turn Facebook (RED) so that by World AIDS Day there’s a whole lot of (RED) on Facebook. Let’s stand together and help fight AIDS in Africa. Just go to: http://budurl.com/fbred

There are 3 things we’d love you to do:
1/. Share: Post a (RED) video and fact
2/. Show: Have a (RED) profile picture
3/. Shop: Give (RED) Save Lives 

Just go to: http://budurl.com/fbred

3,800 die every day in Sub-Saharan Africa from AIDS. Yet it’s a treatable and preventable disease.

Let’s turn Facebook (RED) and let ONE COLOR UNITE US.  

Thanks,

 FYI – the *ticket price will be going up next week*, so right now is the best time to get a deal on your Bonza Bash tickets!  Don&#039;t wait, they are locking down numbers and there will not be a Groupon, according to Alex from Club Vibes, who is also partnering with Bonza.  This will be an extremely well attended event at the Hyatt.

They are picking 2 lucky people this afternoon at random and upgrading their entire order to VIP. It doesn’t matter if you buy 1 ticket or 10 tickets – 2 lucky people will have their orders upgraded to VIP. What’s that you say? You were planning on treating yourself to First Class and buying VIP tickets anyway? If you buy VIP tickets and win this promotion, we’ll double your order for you – eg you buy 2 tickets, we’ll bump it up to 4 so you can bring some friends.

See you on the 21st!

Come out and play!
 (Scott, Amy, and now,,,Meredith!)


See you on the 21st!

Cheers,

Hope you are well.

We&#039;re just getting in touch to let you know that entry is open for Bike for Books 2011.

Last year was a fantastic success with a team of 45 cyclists taking part, raising almost £16,000 to send books to Africa. 

What we&#039;re thinking is, that if 45 people can achieve that much then what could 100 people do? We really want to beat last year&#039;s total.

So, we&#039;re on the look out for folks who love cycling and love books and who&#039;d like to join us on the 4th September for what should be a hugely fun day biking through some fantastic literary landmarks. 

If this sounds like you or maybe someone you know then please do get in touch or take a look at the details on our website. 

We&#039;d love to see you in September!

Timing &amp; Performance Analysis for Embedded Systems

Time: 1:00PM EDT/10:00AM PDT

DESCRIPTION: Real-time behavior of embedded systems is a critical factor in many of our today&#039;s products. What if the driver assistance system in a car doesn&#039;t react fast enough? What if the airbag doesn&#039;t open accurately timed? What if the airplane’s auto pilot doesn&#039;t control the breaking in time during landing? Or what if a X-ray system sends out rays too long?
In this webcast we will demonstrate on the example of automotive in-vehicle E/E systems the combined usage of IBM Rational Rhapsody and INCHRON chronSIM real-time simulation tool to achieve measurable quality and cost efficiency with a model-driven simulation approach.

The DO-178B objectives defined in tables A-1 through A-10 define what needs to be achieved, but allows each organization to define their own processes and sets of tools to map and achieve these objectives. How do you know if your processes and use of tools will be acceptable to the certification authority? Learn all about it in this webinar.

Living out my entrepreneurial dreams is something that has been on my mind for many years and the perfect opportunity has come up to turnaround a startup in the consumer/media space with some ex-Macromedia folks here in San Francisco. My last startup adventure turned out to be Macromedia in 1992 and keeping fingers crossed we have a similar successful outcome!

During my fortunate time here, I&#039;ve had the amazing honor of working with so many smart, fun and talented people who have worked hard to achieve so much. With many of you I&#039;ve seen multimedia in computers go mainstream, the advent of the web, the multimedia-fication of the web with Shockwave, created the Flash Platform as one of the &quot;founding fathers&quot;, pursued new mobile business opportunities for the emerging &quot;smart phone&quot; market in Europe and kicked off a concerted effort to provide developers services beyond the box. Hard to imagine having all those experiences in one career let alone only half of one.

We are in an exciting, transformational time in the industry once again and there are many opportunities that exist. To my Adobe family, with all the amazing technology assets and talented people, there will continue to be major opportunities to pursue. To others with whom I&#039;ve worked with and where friendships have emerged, looking forward to finding other ways to work together and expand the great things we&#039;ve already done together.

I sincerely wish you the very best and look forward to the next time our paths cross again.

My last day will be Thursday, May 12. As tradition states, there will be a going away bash at Mars Bar (798 Brannan Street) on Wednesday, May 11 (kicking off around 4pm). I look forward to raising a glass with you.

In order to achieve a Simply Connected campus, the wired network must be simplified. New Virtual Chassis capability on the EX8200 and EX4500 Series Ethernet Switches enable you to simplify the network while increasing resiliency.

You may assume it is spam but it&#039;s not. I just saw your comment on techcrunch and figured you&#039;d probably like to hear about ark. ark.com is a new website that allows you to earn funds for your causes just by browsing or shopping online all for free. They&#039;ve basically got agreements with sites like google, amazon, e-bay, livingsocial etc. so that every time you use them from ark.com, you can earn money for any cause you want. Yea, it&#039;s been done before but never like this. You should check it out.

It contains new simulators, updated Visual Studio driver templates, and much more. This huge project is nearing completion with several people working on it, and is expected to be available in May 2011. 

An absolute requirement for Platform 6 is that it be 100% compatible with existing astronomy software and drivers. It is currently being tested by driver and application developerws to make sure this requirement is met. For details see the URL below.

Today is the 100th anniversary of International Women&#039;s Day #intlwomensday.  The UN declared that the official theme of this 8 March 2011 is dedicated to &quot;Equal access to education, training and science and technology: Pathway to decent work for women&quot;.

Our Chief Executive, Harriet Green, has recently been quoted in the Telegraph that for her, the issue is about diversity, not gender.   www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/8349110/One-woman-on-the-board-is-a-token-two-is-a-minority-three-means-you-are-really-getting-there.html

But a recent survey by Enigneering Apprentice states that 35% of respondents in the engineering, science or technology sector can name 1 famous or senior woman engineer.   www.engineeringapprentice.co.uk/article/31987/Few-Engineers-can-name-famous-or-senior-women-working-in-their-own-industry.aspx 

As such, we&#039;ve decided to dedicate our facebook and twitter pages to famous women engineers or scientists.  We already have 3 entries: Madame Curie, Setphanie Kwolek &amp; Ada Countess Lovelace. 

Can you name a famous woman engineer? Please post to our element14 facebook page and forward this message.  We will re-tweet and cross-post all entries.</p></div><div class="thread">Facebook User, Jonathan Moore<div class="message"><div class="message_header"><span class="user">Facebook User</span><span class="meta">Sunday, April 3, 2011 at 9:32am EDT</span></div></div><p>It&#039;s a pleasure to see how many wonderful people have joined the ANSI Group on Facebook. You may or may not be aware that ANSI has another more popular and more active Facebook Page.

Facebook has changed a lot since ANSI first created its group. As a result, I would encourage you to join the thousands of people who  have &quot;become a fan&quot; of ANSI on Facebook at http://www.facebook.com/pages/ANSI-American-National-Standards-Institute/46446679081

You&#039;ll find more relevant news, occasional job opportunities and events in addition to finding many more opportunities to connect with people who share similar interests. Instead of visiting the ANSI Group page, please visit ANSI on Facebook at http://www.facebook.com/pages/ANSI-American-National-Standards-Institute/46446679081

Thanks so much for all your support!</p></div><div class="thread">University of Virginia, Jonathan Moore<div class="message"><div class="message_header"><span class="user">University of Virginia</span><span class="meta">Friday, April 1, 2011 at 11:04am EDT</span></div></div><p>Each year the university plants a tree in honor of an individual who has made a significant contribution to the University. This year’s tree will be in honor of Leonard W. Sandridge, the executive vice president and chief operating officer who will be stepping down from his duties at the end of the academic year. He joined the University 44 years ago as a classified employee and worked his way up the ranks to his current post – a job he says is the best in the country.

Peter specifically asked that Barnight be included and said that a Canadian dj is even being played over the internet.  For those of you who haven&#039;t met Peter yet, stop by and say hello - he&#039;s a fun guy.:) His parties are not to be missed, and I see him everywhere in Seattle. :)

The event will take place between 7pm-10pm (or so) at Republiq (2946 1st Ave S), a large night club in the SODO district of Seattle. The club is a modern 8000 sq ft event venue with 40-foot ceilings, a 15-foot waterfall, a state-of-the-art sound system, VIP mezzanine, and a multiple television screen/projection system.

Join us this Friday night in Belltown to say farewell to longtime Barnighter, Bruno Guardia!  Barnight is joining with Bruno’s Freedom Celebration event, as we party it up with 50 of Bruno’s closest friends in the front room of Spitfire. This Belltown bar is a fun mix of Latin American fusion meets sports bar/dj.  As your new host, I am excited to see everyone out!  Look for me in a green jacket with a black shirt. I also have FB app on my phone if you can&#039;t find us. :)  You will be missed, Bruno. :)

</p><div class="message"><div class="message_header"><span class="user">Facebook User</span><span class="meta">Sunday, September 26, 2010 at 11:57pm EDT</span></div></div><p>I am excited to announce the new host for Seattle Barnight, Meredith Russel. While I plan to stay involved recommending a venue here or there and/or attending when I am in town, Meredith will be the leader of the group moving forward and she is the one you will want to contact to find out “where the next barnight is” in the future. 
 
I asked Meredith if she had a message for the group, and here is a quick intro in her own words: 
&quot;Being the New Face of Barnight seems like a natural choice after ten years of Thursday night hijinks, tech startups, camping/hiking, running marathons - all while being heavily involved in local philanthropic and student organizations.  I am warm, outgoing, and have an extensive knowledge of the Seattle scene.  What it really boils down to is the following: I was born to lead Barnight. ;)  
I pledge to lead you down the path of intelligent mindless fun.  See you Thursdays!&quot;
 
On a personal note – I wanted to say thanks again to everyone who came out to join us for a Barnight event in the past few years. I hope you had as much fun attending as I did hosting :)
 
Seattle Barnight – Come out and Play.
-Scott, Amy, and… Meredith!</p></div><div class="thread">Facebook User, Jonathan Moore<div class="message"><div class="message_header"><span class="user">Facebook User</span><span class="meta">Thursday, January 27, 2011 at 1:35pm EST</span></div></div><p>As members of our Facebook Social Mudder page you already know that there are a few of us social networkers that have a crazy idea that we can raise money for wounded veterans by taking part in the “toughest obstacle course in the world.” We’ve signed up for the Tough Mudder event (a 10 mile test of our souls) that’s taking place in just 48 hours. We’ve trained for a months, prepared ourselves mentally and only have one thing left to do… obtain your support. 
 
I won’t include a long post that talks about how difficult this log-carrying, fire-running, lake-swimming, electrical-shock-having, 10 mile run is going to be. No, I won’t try and impress you with our level of insanity. I won’t even mention that 50% of the participants aren&#039;t expected to finish this 3hr event. You won’t find a single word of the crawling through pipes and under wires and hill climbing that we’ll have to complete. Hey, that’s not what this post is about. 
 
This entry is to share our goal – which is within the spirit of the event and it’s worthy cause through the Wounded Warrior Project. Quite simply, to finish together as a team. The teamwork that our small group, the Social Mudders, plan to display will be in the spirit of the event in that finishing together is more important that racing each other. 
 
So if you’re reading this, I’m asking you to take only a few moments and donate just $5 to our team and then pass along the article through your own social channels. The upside is that you’ll be donating to the team that is currently in the lead for the most funds raised – and keeping them out front to show the power of partnering social networks with worthy charitable causes. 
 
*** Your Help (it’s so easy!): ***

The holidays are a busy time - for you, and also for us! 
Here are just a couple of things Foresight has been up to in the last month:
 
December 7th: Foresight Showcased at Breakthrough Philanthropy

Foresight was honored to be one of eight organizations showcased at the Thiel Foundation&#039;s Evening of Breakthrough Philanthropy, an invitation-only event attended by some of Silicon Valley&#039;s top entrepreneurs! Some great connections were made, and we look forward to developing these relationships further. As a result of this event, Foresight was mentioned in multiple news channels this month, including Christine&#039;s comments in the San Francisco Chronicle: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/techchron/detail?entry_id=78523

December 20th: Foresight Awards 2010 Feynman Prizes in Nanotechnology!

This year&#039;s winner of the 2010 Feynman Prize for Experimental work is Masakazu Aono (MANA Center, National Institute for Materials Science, Japan). The winner of the 2010 Feynman Prize for Theory is Gustavo E. Scuseria (Rice University). For more information on recognition of their work, check out: http://www.foresight.org/nanodot/?p=4324
 
WHAT ARE WE PLANNING FOR 2011? A lot.
 
1) 25th Anniversary Reunion Event 
It will be 25 years since Foresight opened its doors. Come reconnect with old friends - and meet some new ones! - as we join with topics experts to explore how to best shape next 25 years of nanotechnology.
 
2) Monthly Community Theme Dinners
Foresight would like to re-start Bay Area community dinner socials which organize around a specific expert lecturer or topic theme. If you would like to help by organizing or giving a talk, please contact us! We would love to hear from you.
 
3) Technical Conference: Fostering Integrative Nanotechnology
With this conference, Foresight will promote collaboration and multi-disciplinary relationships between cutting-edge thinkers and experts from all across academia, R&amp;D, industry, angel investors, and the future-minded activist community. 
 
4) 2011 Feynman Prizes in Nanotechnology
Foresight annually awards this prestigious prize in Theory and Experimental Practice, and has also awarded Communication, Government and Student Prizes in the past. Help us continue to find and support genius.
 
5) Developing and Promoting the Nanotechnology Roadmap
Foresight&#039;s Roadmap was the first of its kind. But to be optimally useful to the field, it must be regularly updated and promoted. Help us guide and support truly transformative nanotechnology, in research and industry.
 
6) New Educational Programs for 2011!
To promote general outreach and inspiration about nanotechnology in the new year, Foresight plans to launch a student essay contest. Foresight also seeks to partner with existing educational outreach programs to more effectively integrate nanotechnology into science curricula.
 
EXCITED BY THESE PROGRAMS?
 
Help us. We want your energy, your insights, and your support.
 
This year&#039;s Annual Challenge Grant is $30,000. That means every dollar you send to Foresight between now and December 31st is matched up to that amount, doubling its value, and your contribution to the future of nanotechnology. 
 
To make a difference today, please donate, either by check to the postal address below, or online at:

This compound is a natural product derived nutraceutical known as TA-65. These findings appear as a research article entitled &#039;A natural product telomerase activator as part of a health maintenance program,&#039; published September 7, 2010 ahead of print in the peer-reviewed journal Rejuvenation Research. The article can be found at http://www.liebertonline.com/doi/abs/10.1089/rej.2010.1085.

Researchers discovered that TA-65 was associated with a statistically significant &quot;age-reversal&quot; effect in the immune system, in that it led to declines in the percentage of senescent cytotoxic T cells and natural killer cells after six to twelve months of use. In addition, further analysis with automated high-throughput confocal microscopy (HT-qFISH) revealed a decline in the percentage of white blood cells with critically short telomeres after twelve to eighteen months of use.

Several peer-reviewed publications have calculated that humans have a theoretical maximum lifespan of 125 years, but our health declines long before that. Many scientists believe that this limit on lifespan and decline in health is imposed by the gradual shortening of our telomeres, structures at the ends of our chromosomes that shorten with every cell division. Telomere shortening is thought to be the &quot;clock of aging&quot; contained within the human body. It has been repeatedly demonstrated that a human cell that does not undergo telomere shortening will divide indefinitely and is, by all available measurements, immortal.

The publication reports that TA-65 can cause telomerase, an enzyme that lengthens telomeres, to become active in human cells. Telomerase activation by TA-65 was shown to lengthen the shortest telomeres in humans, potentially extending human lifespan and healthspan. Telomerase activation is thought to be a keystone of future regenerative medicine and a necessary condition for clinical immortality.

Although TA-65 is probably too weak to completely arrest the aging process, it is the first telomerase activator recognized as safe for human use.

&quot;We are on the cusp of curing aging,&quot; said William Andrews, Ph.D., co-author of this study and President and CEO of Sierra Sciences, LLC. &quot;TA-65 is going to go down in history as the first supplement you can take that doesn&#039;t merely extend your life a few years by improving your health, but actually affects the underlying mechanisms of aging. Better telomerase inducers will be developed in the coming years, but TA-65 is the first of a whole new family of telomerase-activating therapies that could eventually keep us young and healthy forever.&quot;

Telomerase activation has potential medical applications beyond extending human lifespan. Epidemiological studies have shown that short telomeres in humans are a risk factor for diseases including, among others, atherosclerosis, diabetes, Alzheimer&#039;s, and cancer.

The present study also reports encouraging news on the effect of TA-65 on the body&#039;s immune system. Infectious diseases lead to telomere shortening in the immune system, as immune cells divide to fight infections. Telomerase activation should prevent this telomere shortening and allow the body&#039;s immune system to fight a chronic infection indefinitely.

The present study on TA-65 lends support to this hypothesis. In individuals infected with CMV, a virus which prematurely ages the immune system and significantly reduces life expectancy, TA-65 caused an apparent &quot;age reversal&quot; of approximately 5 to 20 years based on one biomarker of immune aging.

For the same reason, telomerase activation is a potential treatment for AIDS. &quot;We tend to see HIV turning into AIDS when the cells of the immune system develop critically short telomeres,&quot; said Andrews. &quot;HIV can essentially cause the immune system to die of old age while the majority of the body is still young. A telomerase activator could theoretically prevent an HIV-positive individual from ever developing AIDS.&quot;

I am writing you because Sierra Sciences has suffered a sudden and unexpected loss of funding. We need $200,000 per month to keep the company operating until mid-2011, when we expect to become self-sufficient with revenue from product sales.

Sierra Sciences is poised to make world-altering breakthroughs in anti-aging medicine. It is no exaggeration to say that we are on the brink of actually curing the disease we call aging! Unfortunately, our current investors were both hit hard by the financial crisis. They can no longer maintain the funding that drives Sierra Sciences’ research.

Looking ahead, Sierra Sciences’ management realizes that in the current economic climate we will have to generate our funding ourselves. To this end, we have formed an alliance with a well-known and very successful manufacturer and retailer of natural products. They will be marketing our discoveries as anti-aging nutraceuticals. This alliance is expected to bring us enough revenue to support further nutraceutical research by mid-2011, and to support pharmaceutical research by mid-2012.

Yesterday, Sierra Sciences’ two investors informed me that they will soon cease all funding of the company. Without interim funding, we will lose not only our opportunity to profit from the nutraceutical market, but also our opportunity to develop our pharmaceutical discoveries into a cure for aging. This would be a tragedy for humanity, as well as a missed opportunity to create a multi-billion dollar industry.

The bottom line is that Sierra Sciences needs $200,000 per month as soon as possible. We will need this interim funding for 6-12 months, at which time we expect to become self-sufficient from nutraceutical sales. This investment would buy the investor significant ownership of the company.

My current investors have also mentioned that they would consider selling some or all of their equity stake in Sierra Sciences. They are still very interested in curing aging and still strongly believe in Sierra Sciences’ path. Together, they have invested just over $20 million and own a controlling interest in the company. They would welcome a conversation on this subject.

Please contact me if you would like to learn more about our situation. All my contact information is included with my signature below. Under my signature are links to various documents that go into more detail about the background of the science and Sierra Sciences’ progress towards a cure for aging.

Thanks,

Bill

And now we&#039;re giving you the chance to show off your commitment to reducing your energy bills and carbon emissions. With the new &#039;Welcome Hohm&#039; Video Challenge, you can share your best green ideas — and win some great prizes along the way. 

Here&#039;s how it works. Starting November 4, simply submit a photo or short video (no more than 2 minutes) of your home and how you have or would like to make it more energy efficient. Maybe you&#039;ve installed an ENERGY STAR dishwasher; or weatherstripped your door and re-sealed any outside leaks; maybe you&#039;re looking to install solar panels on your roof — we want to hear about it. The contest runs until January 5, and each participant can enter one photo and one video. 

We&#039;ll be tracking viewership throughout the contest period, and the top 10 videos and top 10 photos with the most views will be our &#039;Welcome Hohm&#039; finalists. Our panel of judges will then review the finalists and select the best video and photo. The lucky winners will each receive a $2,500 gift certificate to a home improvement store (Home Depot, Lowe’s or Do It Best) to help turn their green vision into a reality. The runners-up in each category will receive an HP ProBook 4510s Notebook PC (ENERGY STAR rated, of course). Additionally, we&#039;ll be giving a copy of Windows 7 Home Premium to the first 100 qualified entrants. So get started!

Grand Prize Winners will be selected and notified around January 18th. We&#039;ll be distributing copies of Windows 7 Home Premium to the winning entrants on a rolling basis. 

And if you&#039;re not the next Scorsese or Tarantino, don&#039;t worry. We&#039;re judging entries based on your concept, commitment, and creativity — not necessarily on your video editing skills or HD camera. So, if you&#039;ve made some great energy efficiency improvements (or have some great energy-saving plans in mind), we want to see them, even if you shot the video from your cell phone. 

Those are the basics. Simply upload a photo to http://micorosofthohm.ning.com or upload a video to YouTube and reply to one of our sample videos:

•	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlFA8kEM2HQ

am kommenden Sonntag wählt Nordrhein-Westfalen. Dabei geht es um viel. Es geht darum, ob das Land weiterhin stabil regiert wird, oder ob eine rot-rot-grüne Regierung die Erfolge der letzten Jahre gefährdet.

Die Bilanz der CDU-geführten Landesregierung unter Jürgen Rüttgers ist hervorragend: Gegenüber Mai 2005 gibt es heute über 250.000 sozialversicherungspflichtig Beschäftigte mehr. Über 8.000 neue Lehrerstellen wurden geschaffen, der Unterrichtsausfall halbiert. Auch in Zukunft garantiert die CDU, dass Nordrhein-Westfalen stabil und erfolgreich bleibt.

Deshalb meine Bitte: Unterstützen Sie die CDU in Nordrhein-Westfalen – etwa mit einer Registrierung auf der Unterstützerseite http://www.nrw-fuer-ruettgers.de. Helfen Sie mit, dass das Land auch künftig verlässlich und entschlossen regiert wird.

U2 tour producer/promoter Arthur Fogel, CEO of Live Nation Global Touring, said, &#039;Although we understand the disappointment to U2 fans, first and foremost comes the recovery of Bono.&#039;

Additional details on rescheduled dates will follow shortly and fans are encouraged to hold on to their tickets.

Bono has now been discharged from Ludwig Maximilians-University (LMU) Hospital in Munich where he underwent emergency surgery on Friday, following a back injury. In order to fully recover, he is under doctor&#039;s orders to start a rehabilitation program and to recuperate for at least eight weeks. 

Paul McGuinness said, &#039;Our biggest and I believe best tour has been interrupted and we&#039;re all devastated. For a performer who lives to be on stage, this is more than a blow. He feels robbed of the chance to do what he does best and feels like he has badly let down the band and their audience. Which is of course nonsense. His concerns about more than a million ticket buyers whose plans have been turned upside down, we all share, but the most important thing right now is that Bono make a full recovery. We&#039;re working as fast as we can with Live Nation to reschedule these dates.&#039;

Sarah and I are starting work on the poster session proposal and I&#039;m looking for potential participants now. 

The broad topic is food and health, and should relate in some way to the meeting theme of &quot;circulation.&quot; 

Topics that immediately come to my mind are the origins of agriculture, food sharing, forager-farmer interactions, cash cropping and export economies, famine and food security, urban food deserts, mixed economies (e.g. horticulture and wage labor), ethnobotany and trade in traditional medicine, and refrigerated shipping/trucking. Obviously, this topic could take us in a number of directions. 

We&#039;re looking for posters from any subfield of anthropology and welcome submissions from both students and faculty, though student participation is highly encouraged. 

This is what the AAA website has to say about &quot;circulation:&quot; 

&quot;We can think in terms of circulation across time as well as space, through different organizing principles, and in a variety of shapes and forms.&quot;

&quot;The idea of circulation invites us to consider what triggers, facilitates, constrains, disrupts or stops flows; what is at stake in these processes, and for whom; and what their consequences might be for humans and for the environment. It opens up questions about what exactly circu­lates: signs, objects or bodies. Do different things circulate in different ways? Do they change or remain constant? What new phenomena, arrangements and inequalities does circula­tion produce? How are resources and ways of understanding them identified, made sense of, produced and distributed in the process? How and why do rates and types of circulation vary across time and space? What crystallizes and what continues to flow and reshape?&quot; 

So, if you have an idea for a poster that you&#039;d like to present please send me an abstract by Monday if you can. I need a total of 7 participants. You can send your abstract to me at cnp304&#064;mail.missouri.edu or here on Facebook if that is easier. 

Regards, 

Christina Pomianek


PS, If you&#039;ve never presented a poster before, here is some information from the AAA website about poster session and submission guidelines: 

FEAR NOT THE POSTER
Agustin Fuentes
Notre Dame U
 
For some reason, many anthropologists avoid the poster as a viable and effective means of presenting their work. I think we anthropologists are a bit misguided in our general lack of enthusiasm for the poster presentation. The poster presents an interactive, visual medium for conveying our research, theory and practice. We need to realize that we have imposed an unspoken caste system on conference presentations, and placed posters on a lower rung. This system must be overthrown. Here are five reasons why:

        Great visibility for your work: A more diverse group of people will see your work as a poster than if it is tucked away in a specialized session that only the presenters attend. Our Annual Meetings are huge, and seeing more than just a few presentations can be very difficult. If the poster session location is decent and your poster well-designed, you will attract not only those seeking your poster out, but also passers-by and others who may never have otherwise had the opportunity to see your presentation
·         Time to interact with the audience/peers: Unlike the podium session, you actually get to chat with those interested in your work. The format and time allotted to posters facilitates a broader discourse in the moment. No more 15 minutes and out . . . here you actually have the time to elaborate, discuss and engage in academic exchange, rather than just preaching from the podium.
·         Dissemination of supplemental information: The venue and format of poster presentations allow for the easy distribution of manuscripts, related articles, utilization of video and even websites. You can easily bring reprints or even set up a laptop or VCR/TV to enhance the information presented in the poster. Posters can be a gateway to connections, student interest and collegial collaboration (which is pretty much the purpose for presenting in the first place).
·         You can always see the poster: Unlike the problems of “low talkers,” broken microphones and poor acoustics that frequent podium sessions, a well-presented poster always is accessible. Clear fonts, images and graphics allow the audience to absorb the information at their pace and engage the presenter directly with questions, compliments or relevant issues.
·         Poster sessions always run on time: One of the main drawbacks to AAA Annual Meetings is running across gargantuan lobbies and labyrinth-like hallways in search of strangely named rooms with the session you want to see, only to arrive and find that it is running 47 minutes late. Poster sessions run on time and allow for a casual perusal of the presentations. No more sneaking out the back and knocking over the slide projector. Poster presentations let you plan your visit accordingly, and you can come and go without embarrassing moments!

In addition to these five main points, posters also can be a valuable means of presenting multiauthored work, especially with projects that incorporate students. For students, a poster can be an important introduction to professional presentations and give them a chance to engage in public academic discourse prior to attempting a podium presentation.

Hope you got the invite to the event - Hope for Haiti (a candlelight vigil and memorial)

Thursday Jan 21 &#064; 7:30 in the Chapel of All Faiths

Hosted by Wesley Foundation, but not a specifically religious gathering - just a chance to reflect, remember, and learn about ways to give to the people of Haiti who desperately need it.

If you have any questions, don&#039;t hesitate to contact me (Allie Robinson).  

See you there!</p></div><div class="thread">John Turnberg, John Maurice, , , Jonathan Fest, Andrew Buck, Johanna Rothman, John Sumser, Joelle G.

From the home page you can acquaint yourself with the author, his philosophy, and the causes that elicit the purpose he answers to in his own life.  If the background and sense of the book appeal to you or someone you know, it can be purchased from the &quot;Get it Now!&quot; function on
http://www.thecorruptrepublic.com/book/Home.html or you can order it from amazon.com.

The Author is busy finishinga comprehensive study on the Strategic Implementation of Project Management that serves as his contribution back to his original profession, and includes the lessons learned from years in the trenches.

When recently asked about the inspiration for “The Corrupt Republic”, the author says the following:

“The book was a fun challenge for me for a few reasons. The book itself came out of an idea I had while asleep and dreaming one night that I couldn’t get out of my head for some days afterward. I knew I had the genesis of the book and many of the ideas around it, but was having trouble picturing myself writing the work. So I tried it, and over the course of weeks the work continued to take shape. Before I knew it, I was writing the last chapter and looking back on the experience.

“It was completely wild because I never did and probably never will consider myself a writer, much less one who would have written a political thriller based on the premise on the book. I turned the draft pieces over to a few people and was surprised with the feedback. So if I only live once in this world, I decided I’d take the chance and finish it for publication, and already have started the focus for the sequel.”

Thanks for your consideration.

Sometimes, however, you’ll want to limit who sees what. Here are three tools to help:

(1) Age Restrictions for Pages: You can restrict your Page to users over age 13, 17, 18, 19, or 21, or the legal drinking age where they live. On your Page’s edit page, scroll down to “Settings” at the bottom.

(2) Targeted Messaging: When you send a message to fans, you can target it by geography, gender, and age. For example, a musician can promote a concert to fans in the area. When sending an update, check the “Target this update” box.

(3) New FBML Tags: If you use FBML (http://www.new.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=4949752878), you can restrict content by country and age. For example, if you have licensed content for U.S. and Canada users only, you can to restrict it to those countries, and show alternative content to other users. More details are on the Facebook Developers Blog: http://developers.facebook.com/news.php?blog=1&amp;story=150.
